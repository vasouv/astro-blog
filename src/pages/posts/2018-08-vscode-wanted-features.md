I really like VS Code for Java development, the extension by Red Hat is exceptional and updated regularly, Pivotal has created a number of Spring Boot extensions and we even have a Test Runner and Lombok support.

NetBeans is still my favourite IDE and I use it mainly for Java EE, there's minimal configuration and everything pretty much works out of the box (for my usage at least). If VS Code had a couple more features that I use in NetBeans, I would definitely try it for "larger" projects.

_But, I don't know which features should be in Code itself or extensions etc._

**Project wide renaming / refactoring**

Currently, the "Rename Symbol" in Code doesn't change the filename if it's a class rename.

**Application server deployment**

I would definitely like support for application servers such as Glassfish, Payara, Wildfly and traditional application deployment.

**Templates for Java EE files**

Create templates for most used Java EE files, persistence.xml, web.xml, Facelets etc

**JSF support**

This goes without saying for me, JSF is still used, junior devs like me still use it and proper support should be there.

**Generate accessor methods**

Although Code offers autocomplete when you start writing "get" and "set", for many fields it's nice to have a GUI and select which fields to generate.

**pom.xml support**

It'd be nice to have autocomplete for the pom file and auto-search for the specific fields, so it displays the results on-the-fly. It isn't that hard to go online and search for dependencies but it saves time to do it from the file itself.

If I think of more things, I'll add them here.
